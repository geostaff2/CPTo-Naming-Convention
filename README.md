# CPTo Naming Convention

## Purpose
The CPTo naming convention is designed to standardize the naming of components in projects to enhance clarity, readability, and maintenance. By following this convention, developers can easily understand the purpose and function of each component within a codebase.

The CPTo naming convention, created by Richard S. Olsen, PhD PE, is a method for naming variables systemically in all computer programming languages. The goal of CPTo is to offer **clarity, readability, and quick insight** into variables' contexts.

## Syntax
The syntax for names using the CPTo convention generally follows:

```plaintext
[BaseName]_8[DataType][ScopeIndicator][Additional Notes]
```

### Key Conventions:
1. **BaseName**: A clear, descriptive name that represents the purpose of the variable.
2. **`_8` Symbol**: This unique symbol symbolizes a chain-link connection to clarify type/scope.
3. **DataType**: Encodes meaningful type information:
   - `int` = Integer
   - `dbl` = Double
   - `str` = String
   - `sng` = Single value
   - `lbl` = Label
4. Scope indicators: 
   - `I` input example or
